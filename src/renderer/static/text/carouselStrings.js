  ` Welcome! Since Zbay is something new and different, an explanation is due...`,
  `The first question to answer is "What's taking so long?"
`,
  `It's actually a long and important story, but we have time!`,
  `But first, let’s go over a few basics:`,
  `On Zbay you’ll be able to do things like:`,
  `Register a username. (@yourname on Zcash)
`,
  `Send messages to others.
`,
  `Register channel names that you and you alone will control.
`,
  `Advertise items for sale in private or public channels.
`,
  `Buy stuff from people you don't know (caveat emptor!)
`,
  `Send money to friends, even friends who haven't joined yet.
`,
  `You can even make money using Zbay…
`,
  `By promoting Zcash to friends or on the Internet.
`,
  `And earning a share of what they spend.
`,
  `Okay, now let’s continue our explanation...
`,
  `Of why Zbay is so slow to get started. 
`,
  `Here goes!
`,
  `When you first run Zbay, it downloads a large amount of data to "catch up" with the network.
`,
  `Downloading this data can take days or more, depending on your Internet connection.
`,
  `It might also slow down your computer, or make your laptop heat up. (We're sorry!)
`,
  `The good news is, it'll be done soon. You should only have to do this once.
`,
  `The next time you run Zbay, it might be slower than most apps, but it shouldn't take forever or slow down your computer.
`,
  `The next question to answer is, "Why?"
`,
  `Here's a hint. The answer starts with the letter "M"...
`,
  `And ends in "Uckerberg."
`,
  `Did you guess it? Good!
`,
  `In short, Zbay is slow because we're attempting something that hasn't been done before.
`,
  `We want to build a patch of online life that's controlled by the people of the Internet.
`,
  `Not by one rich man in California, like Facebook is.
`,
  `Or by a reprehensible dictatorship, like WeChat and TikTok are.
`,
  `Or by a corporation legally bound to squeeze as much money from us as possible, like Google is.
`,
  `Technically and institutionally speaking, this is hard to do. But it's not impossible.
`,
  `To do it, Zbay builds on two technical/institutional building blocks: "free software" and "blockchain".
`,
  `These technical/institutional building blocks are "free software" and "blockchain".
`,
  `Spoiler: the second building block, "blockchain," is the part that's slow.
`,
  `But the first building block, "free software," depends on it, which we'll explain in a moment.
`,
  `Our story starts in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1980. (Like, back when all computers were this slow.)
`,
  `A bearded guy named Richard M. Stallman, annoyed by a broken printer, had a powerful revelation...
`,
  `He realized that software makers had legal and technical power to control software users...
`,
  `And that they could use this power in nefarious ways, to extort, spy, censor, or worse.
`,
  `Stallman defined what he called the "four freedoms" to rally software engineers around a brighter future.
`,
  `The four freedoms were... (drumroll, please)
`,
  `1. The freedom to run a program as you wish, for any purpose.
`,
  `2. The freedom to understand how a program works, and change it how you wish.
`,
  `3. The freedom to redistribute copies of a program, to help others.
`,
  `4. The freedom to redistribute your changes, so the wider community can benefit from your work.
`,
  `In 1989, Stallman wrote the GNU GPL, a software license that encoded the four freedoms into law.
`,
  `The GNU GPL was politically ingenious and breathtakingly awesome for the world.
`,
  `It gave software engineers a legal, contractual way to give their users all four freedoms...
`,
  `...Which meant that anyone in the world could build on their work.
`,
  `But only if they granted others the same freedoms...
`,
  `And released it under a GPL-compatible license!
`,
  `Because of these clever rules, the body of code available under the GNU GPL grew like wildfire.
`,
  `Stallman called software that respected your freedoms "Free Software".
`,
  `And he called licenses like the GNU GPL "copyleft." (As opposed to "copyright." Nerd humor, sigh.)
`,
  `Free software became one of the most successful social movements in human history.
`,
  `Right now nearly every company in the world uses free software.
`,
  `And an operating system built on free software (Android) powers 2.5 billion phones and tablets.
`,
  `Computing isn't just for rich people anymore, and it's largely thanks to free software.
`,
  `Free software also let heroes like Edward Snowden and journalist Laura Poitras communicate privately...
`,
  `So they could successfully blow the whistle on the world's most powerful spy agencies.
`,
  `Most of all, free software contains a powerful institutional guarantee:
`,
  `If software makers start being evil its users can "fork".
`,
  `That is, they can band together, take the code, and build in a new direction.
`,
  `Zbay is free software. Anyone can fork us. That keeps us honest.
`,
  `And we love it.
`,
  `You might ask, "If free software is so great, why is the Internet run by a new class of robber baron?"
`,
  `Well, the free software movement had an important limitation.
`,
  `Because of the freedoms it granted, companies could use GPL-licensed code however they chose...
`,
  `And if they didn't *distribute* it, they didn't have to give their users the four freedoms...
`,
  `And while selling an app was "distributing" software...,`,
  `Using code to run a website (like Facebook.com, or Google.com) wasn't.
`,
  `Copyleft licenses didn't have the same power over a website...,`,
  `Precisely because free software gives so much freedom to its users.
`,
  `Remember: the first freedom lets anyone (including you, and Facebook) use the software however they want.
`,
  `Moreover, the idea of "having control" over software on a server run by someone else is an illusion.
`,
  `Facebook is mostly running on Facebook's computers, not yours.
`,
  `If they were doing something evil with your data, how would you know? It's their computer.
`,
  `If you wanted to change something important, how would you? It's their computer.
`,
  `And if you wanted to change something in Facebook's code, why would others let you?
`,
  `You could be an awful person. You could make the code do something awful. 
`,
  `Okay, we know *you're* not an awful person.
`,
  `But what about those other 7 billion people? Some of them are total psychos.
`,
  `Control over Facebook's code is too much power, so Facebook users trust Zuckerberg. 
`,
  `Which suits him fine.
`,
  `Stallman's "four freedoms" only made sense when our apps ran on *our* computers.
`,
  `Once we started using websites like Facebook or Google Docs, those companies had freedom. Not us.
`,
  `We can't go back to the 90s and run apps we bought on floppy disks or CD-ROMS.
`,
  `Humans are social beings. Our software will be social too.
`,
  `But until you could make a shared, global, social app that ran on *our own* computers...
`,
  `One that you could trust to not be immediately ruined by psychos...
`,
  `Humanity's best tool for enforcing computing freedom and ethics, free software...
`,
  `...was stuck on the sidelines of the battlefield for freedom!
`,
  `(Yes, that was a mixed metaphor, sorry.)
`,
  `Worse, building a social network that runs on everyone's computer is super hard.
`,
  `Think about it. It's kind of a paradox.
`,
  `If everyone runs the app on their own computers, and it's free software...
`,
  `That means everyone (including the psychos) could change the app to do whatever they want...
`,
  `And basically ruin it for everyone.
`,
  `This paradox teased a good percentage of computer science grad students throughout the nineties and early 2000s.
`,
  `A) Because it was trippy. B) Because you might get famous if you solved it.
`,
  `And they came up with some cool ideas. But nothing ever really caught on.
`,
  `Everything that got made was too wonky. Or it didn't really work.
`,
  `Then... 
`,
  `In 2008…
`,
  `Another drumroll, please...
`,
  `When most developers were scrambling to learn how to build iPhone apps, or Facebook apps…
`,
  `And everyone else was about to lose their job, or their house...
`,
  `Something really historic and surprising happened.
`,
  `Someone, it seemed, had come out of the woodwork with an answer to the paradox.
`,
  `And the answer wasn't just an academic paper, it was working code.
`,
  `Working code you could actually sort of use!
`,
  `The person was Satoshi Nakamoto.
`,
  `Oh, and that's definitely not his real name.
`,
  `Oh, and he might not actually have ever existed.
`,
  `Oh, and the project was called Bitcoin.
`,
  `You've probably heard of it?
`,
  `And you probably have tons of ideas about it.
`,
  `Maybe you got rich off it, maybe you lost your life savings.
`,
  `Maybe it's the answer to the tyranny of big banks.
`,
  `Maybe it's a hypercapitalist acid trip from Burning Man.
`,
  `The important thing is that Bitcoin was the first to crack the paradox.
`,
  `It was the first global network that ran on *our* computers but could connect us to others anywhere.
`,
  `Bitcoin, of course, was free software.
`,
  `Bitcoin was missing one important thing though: privacy.
`,
  `Anything you did there would be visible to the entire world, they just might not know it was you.
`,
  `As Bitcoin grew in popularity, newer projects attempted to address Bitcoin's lack of privacy.

`,
  `Zcash is one of them.
`,
  `Zbay is built on Zcash.
`,
  `Where Facebook’s apps connect to Facebook's servers, Zbay connects to Zcash.
`,
  `Zcash itself is a network of people running the Zcash app on their own computers.
`,
  `Every computer on the Zcash network needs a record of every Zcash transaction ever made.
`,
  `That's what we're downloading now. 
`,
  `That's why it's taking forever. It’s ginormous. 
`,
  `Zbay chose Zcash for a few reasons.
`,
  `It's one of the few networks that lets us send messages privately.
`,
  `It aims to offer strong anonymity to message recipients (though not to senders, not yet at least.)
`,
  `Beginners can buy it quickly on sites like Coinbase.
`,
  `Most of all, its founders are pioneers in building technology for online privacy.
`,
  `They were working on privacy tech decades before the crypto bubble.
`,
  `And now, thanks in part to the crypto bubble, Zcash is a well-funded project.
`,
  `It’s a great base to build on.
`,
  `By building on Zcash, we can trust privacy-tech-pioneer-geniuses to keep everyone safe.
`,
  `While we focus on building an app you can use.
`,
  `Free software and protocols are amazing for facilitating this kind of collaboration.
`,
  `So, we did it.
`,
  `We told the story of why this is taking so long.
`,
  `Again, just as a reminder, on Zbay you can...
`,
  `Register a username (@yourname on Zcash)
`,
  `Send messages
`,
  `Advertise things for sale
`,
  `Buy stuff
`,
  `Send money to friends, even friends who haven't joined yet.
`,
  `Earn money by promoting Zcash to friends or on the Internet.
`,
  `Register channel names that you and you alone will control.
`,
  `You could register a channel today.
`,
  `And moderation features for channel owners are coming soon.
`,
  `May your Internet be fast and your peers plentiful.
`,
  `This space belongs to you.
`,
  `Be nice!
`,
  `Really, it's important. Because there's nobody here to make you.
`,
  `Not anymore.
